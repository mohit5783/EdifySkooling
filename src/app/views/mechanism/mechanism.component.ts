Promoting students to next session and class-section depends on two things, 1). Student is pass or fail in main examination and 2). Student will be continue in school or leaving from school. If student is pass and will continue to school, only then student will be promoted to next session and class-section. If student is fail and continue to school then students will be promoted to next session but class-section will be remain as it is. If student is pass but leaving to student then student will not be promoted to next session nor promoted to next class-section. This is the whole mechanism of Promote Student. Smart School automatically manage promotion of session and class-section. To promote students first select Promote In Session, Class, Section and for every student select Current Result pass or fail and Next Session Status continue or leave and click on Promote button from bottom right.</p></li>  <ul>"
